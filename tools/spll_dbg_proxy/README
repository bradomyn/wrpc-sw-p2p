SoftPLL debug proxy

Tomasz Wlostowski/2012

Purpose of the program:
spll_dbg_proxy acts as a bridge between the hardware debug queue in the softpll core and an user-space plotting application (spll_debugger.py), making
it possible to record the response of the PLL on-the-fly and analyze it later. The program continuously polls the queue and provides the data for client
applications over a TCP/IP connection. 

How to use:
- run as root. The program will connect to the first SPEC.
- run spll_debugger.py (you may need to change the hostname), edit the start event and the number of samples to be acquired
- reload wrc LM32 firmware
- a window with the response should pop up in few seconds

Remarks:
The version included in wrpc-sw works with the wr_core_demo bitstream, with the softpll mapped at 0x20200. This will change in the future with the inclusion
of SDB descriptors in the VHDL.
